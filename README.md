# EmotionDetect ðŸ˜„

EmotionDetect is a facial emotion recognition project built using deep learning and computer vision. 
It is capable of detecting human emotions in real-time using a webcam. 
The model is trained on the Face Expression Recognition Dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset). 
The dataset includes labeled grayscale facial images categorized into seven emotional classes: 0 - angry, 1 - disgust, 2 - fear, 3 - happy, 4 - neutral, 5 - sad, and 6 - surprise.
The model was trained on macOS Ventura and completed training in 992 minutes and 21.9 seconds for 100 epochs and has the [accuracy: 0.7524 - loss: 0.6834 - val_accuracy: 0.6288 - val_loss: 1.0561] 
The project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying facial expressions and includes functionality for both training the model and running real-time detection through a camera. 
After downloading and organizing the dataset, users can train the model using the provided Python scripts, evaluate its performance, and activate live emotion recognition via webcam.
